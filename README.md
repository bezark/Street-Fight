# Street-Fight
 
Hey Dave,

So the theme for this game jam is "street fight" which I find pretty boring... But there is something kind of interesting abou tlike a guitar hero style thing where you can move up and down and change poses when you do and your constantly running?

Currently if you open the project and run the main scene and press up down left or right you'll move one square. If you hold ASD or F while you do you'll change to a different shape. maybe it's rock paper scissors? I don't know I'm just  messing around
i'm not attached to any of this

add whatever you want lol
